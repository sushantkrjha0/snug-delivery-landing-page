## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- All content JSON files must be present in the `content/` directory
- TSX files must be in their expected locations under `src/`

## Troubleshooting

If you see warnings about patterns not found, this is usually due to:
1. Content that was manually modified outside the JSON structure
2. New content that hasn't been added to the mappings yet
3. File formatting changes

The script will still work for the majority of content even if some patterns fail to match.
